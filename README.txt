VIDEO TO ASCII PROGRAM
  ----------------------
  Required:
  
  Make sure to install and save ffmpeg.exe to the main folder as this is a required file for the 
  programs core function. note aswell this is the only required external file that is needed to be
  installed. Aslong as this file is present within the main folder the program should run smoothly.

  Basic Notes:

  To convert a video to ASCII first you need to place the chosen video into the videos folder,
  after which you can load up the program and follow the on screen prompts.

  Please read through the notes on screen for proper use of the program to ensue the cleanest
  and best results, note aswell that the process for the program to convert your video into
  images it will be able to process may take some time depending on both your computer as well
  as the length of the video you are trying to convert.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  General Use Notes:

  When using the program before initiating the process video function please re-size the console
  window to the appropriate size, This is mainly required as having a larger window will make the 
  final ASCII display alot more clear. Additionally try to keep the window as similar as you can to
  the input video's aspect ratio.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Examples are shown below:

  Most video will look best in either one of these simple aspect ratios so try them both out as most
  resloutions look fairly similar, if however it dosnt look as good in either of these tweek the size
  here and there and it should work out better.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Extra Notes:

  If you encounter any issues with the final ASCII result being either too hard distinguish or too bright
  and or too dark then, i have also implemented the ability to customize the brightness scale by either
  using the default one, the inverted one or just a custom one.

  Note however if you choose to use a custom one, the program will not save those changes it will always 
  revert back to default. if you need to save any custom brightness scales you choose to use please create
  a .txt file and save it otherwise i have left some lines just below where you can save any custom scales
  you choose to implement.

  CUSTOM BRIGHTNESS SCALES:

  Setting 1: XXXXXX
  Setting 2: XXXXXX
  Setting 3: XXXXXX
  Setting 4: XXXXXX
